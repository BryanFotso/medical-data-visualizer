# Medical Data Visualizer

This is the boilerplate for the Medical Data Visualizer project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/medical-data-visualizer

This project is part of a data analysis challenge that focuses on visualizing medical examination data. Using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, you'll analyze and visualize relationships between medical factors, body measurements, lifestyle choices, and the presence of cardiovascular diseases.

## ðŸ“‹ Challenge Overview

**Objectives**:
Use **Pandas** to analyze the dataset and answer the following questions:

- How many people of each cholesterol level (normal, above normal, well above normal) are present in the dataset? 
- How many people have an abnormal glucose level?
- What is the distribution of smokers and non-smokers in the dataset?
- What is the impact of physical activity on the presence of cardiovascular disease?
- What percentage of people with high cholesterol and high glucose have cardiovascular disease?
- Calculate the BMI for each person, and add a new column showing whether they are overweight (BMI > 25).
- Generate a plot showing the relationship between lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity) and the presence of cardiovascular disease.
- Generate a heatmap of the correlation matrix of the dataset.
